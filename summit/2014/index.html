		    <h2>2014 Cyber Security Summit</h2>

		    
<p>The Cyber Security Club at Virginia Tech is hosting our annual Cyber
Security Summit, a networking event and capture the flag competition, on
Saturday, April 26, 2014. We aim to connect students in the midatlantic region
with an interest in cyber security.</p>

<p>In the morning, we will host speakers from the industry and academia to
discuss the current state of cyber security as well as some innovative and
exciting research in the field.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, we will host a capture the flag competition to give
students the opportunity to hone their skills and engage in some friendly
competition as they analyze and attack a network built by the officers of the
Cyber Security Club. We will award points to teams that successfully compromise
and retrieve flags from devices on the network, complete other challenges, or
crack passwords. Points may also be awarded to teams that creatively
participate in other ways.</p>

<p>As usual, food, drinks, and prizes for successful teams will be
provided.</p>
