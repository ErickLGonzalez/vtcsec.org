<p>We are a student organization in Computer Engineering and Computer Science at
Virginia Tech founded in spring 2011 with the goal of encouraging and
expanding the study of cyber security and related fields.
We aim to develop awareness and expertise in all areas of cyber security including physical,
social, hardware, and software.</p>

<p>We will be hosting a CTF competition which we call "The Summit."  All students are welcome to participate,
    even from other schools!  The summit for 2017 is being planned as you read.  If you would like to make boxes
    for the summit, or aid in its administration, email the officers!</p>
