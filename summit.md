## What is it?

The Summit is a CTF competition put on by the Cyber Security Club at Virginia Tech and a networking opportunity for students interested in security.
Teams and Students from ourside of the Blacksburg and Roanoke area will be provided with free hotel rooms the night before. These will be offered to students of universities outside of the New River Valley who sign up before March 4th.

## When and where is it?

It will be hosted at Virginia Tech on **March 23rd** at Room 320 in New Classroom Building. Note - Parking will be free on the weekend, there are lots near by at the Perry Street Lot and Garage.

Hotel rooms will be provided to those that have to travel too far to leave in the morning, please request these when you register.

## What Challenges are there?

VTCSec has designed new challenges for people to solve in person.  We have created challenges related
to real issues in security and have used our experience competing in past CTF's.  We will be hosting challenges
in the following areas:

* Exploitation
* Embedded Hardware
* Networking
* Web applications
* Forensics
* Reversing
* Cryptography
* Operational Security

In addition, this year's theme is <b>THUNDERDOME</b>. This means that there will be multiple challenges where all teams will have to continually attack the central service to steal control from each other.

## What are the team rules?

Teams will have a maximum of 5 members. Teams can register at the event, and do not need to all be from one school. There is a maximum of 2 graduate students per team.
