## What is it?

The Summit is a CTF competition put on by the Cyber Security Club at Virginia Tech and a networking opportunity for students interested in security.
Teams and students will be invited to participate.  Any student is allowed to join.  If your school or club
did not receive an invitation, please email <a href="mailto:officers@vtcsec.org">officers@vtcsec.org</a>.

VTCSec has designed new challenges for people to solve in person.  We have created challenges related
to real issues in security and have used our experience competing in past CTF's.  We will be hosting challenges
in the following areas:

* Exploitation
* Embedded Hardware
* Networking
* Web applications
* Forensics
* Reversing
* Cryptography
* Operational Security

Diverse skill sets on teams will be helpful.  Challenges are designed to be difficult to be solved by one person alone.

## When and where is it?

It will be hosted at Virginia Tech on **March 17th** at Room 110 A&B in the New Classroom Building. Note - the parking lot next to NCB is open to everyone on Saturdays.   

It will run all day.  Food and drink will be provided. Hotel rooms will be provided to those that have to travel too far to leave in the morning, please request these directly by email as soon as possible.

## What are the team rules?

Teams will have a maximum of 5 members. Teams do not need to be all from one school, and each school may have multiple teams.
