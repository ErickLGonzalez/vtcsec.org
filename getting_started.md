If you're on this page I'm going to assume that you are new to the Cyber Security Club. Welcome, we're glad to have you. This page is intended to help you start participating in the club. We have weekly meetings that offer students the opportunity to get a jumpstart on learning security topics that are not typically taught until the 4000 level in the ECE and CS departments here at VT. 

Some members limit their participation to coming to those meetings and listening to talks and seminars given by other members. That's fine, but this page is not really intended for those members, it is intended for those who want to get more out of their membership in the club and are willing to put in extra time on their own in order to do so. 

## What do I have to know to join the club?
Nothing. We have no formal prerequisites and have members from a number of different backgrounds including computer science, computer or electrical engineering, mathematics, physics, philosophy and physics. More important than what you bring to your first meeting is your willingness to learn. We won't hold your hand (okay, maybe a little bit) and we expect you to be able to learn things independently as well as at the talks and tutorials we do at meetings. The more time you put in outside of club meetings the more proficient you will become in this field. 

That said, basic competency in programming is extremely helpful. Knowing a bit about the C programming language, Python, and x86 assembly will help you to understand code that often shows up on screen at meetings. Having a basic understanding of network protocols such as HTTP and TCP/IP never hurts. Some familiarity with the central ideas of public key and symmetric key cryptography is useful. These are things that are difficult to teach in a single meeting, but there are many tutorials and explanations of these topics on the Internet that you might want to read in addition to attending meetings.  

## What topics are involved in cyber security? 
This is a tough question. Cyber security is an extraordinarily interdisciplinary field. Some practical topics in security include vulnerability discovery, operational security, forensics and exploit creation. On the more defensive end you'll still find forensics helpful but also need to know how to write secure code. There is a also huge body of  computer science and mathematics theory that is relevant to the security space. 

## Why study offensive security? What is CTF?
I can't say it any better than Trail of Bits did [here][ctffg].

## IRC / Slack
If you are already familiar with IRC or want to make the officers of the club happy, set up a persistent connection to our IRC channel #vtcsec on OFTC. You could also connect using the web client by using the link under 'contact' at the bottom of this page. If you are new and don't want to go through the process of setting this up, we also support [Slack][slack]. These are both great ways to contact the officers or just to chat with other members of the club when we're not at meetings. Most of the conversations between members who have been around for a while happen on IRC. 

## Where to start learning?
Wargames, wargames, wargames. Learn the skills needed to complete a few introductory wargames and you will have a much better understanding of what is going on at club meetings. I highly recommend you complete [this][bandit] and then work on either [this][natas] or [this][narnia]. If you are particulary interested in exploitation, [this][smash] is also quite good. There are also other wargames linked on the [Resources][rec] page. Read 'Request for Comments' such as the ones for [TCP][rfc793], [UDP][rfc768], [IP][rfc791]. If you've completed one or more of the wargames listed here and are hungry for more, come talk to us! We'd love you to join us in playing an online CTF.
