If you're on this page I'm going to assume that you are new to the Cyber Security Club.
Welcome, we're glad to have you.
This page is intended to help you start participating in the club.
We host weekly meetings that offer students the opportunity to learn many security topics that are never taught in classes.

## What do I have to know to join the club?
*Nothing.*
We have no formal prerequisites and have members from a number of different backgrounds including computer science, electrical and computer engineering, mathematics, philosophy and physics.

*That being said.*
More important than what knowledge you bring to your first meeting is your willingness to learn.
We won't hold your hand and we expect you to be able to learn things independently.
The more time you put in outside of club meetings the more proficient you will become in this field. 
The more proficient you become the more fun you will have.

## What topics are involved in cyber security?
This is a tough question.
Cyber security is an extraordinarily broad field.
Read [Bruce Schneier's][schneier] commentary on the discipline. Read all of it, but pay particular attention to his commentary on the security mindset. If you can't think like an attacker, you are going to have a hard time building systems that are robust against attack.

## Why study offensive security? What is a CTF?
I can't say it any better than Trail of Bits did [here][ctffg].

## Where to start learning?
Competency in programming is extremely helpful.
Knowing the [C programming language][C], [Python][Py], and x86 assembly will help you to understand code that often shows up on screen at meetings.

Having working knowledge of network protocols such as TCP/IP and HTTP never hurts. Read 'Request for Comments' such as the ones for [TCP][rfc793], [UDP][rfc768], and [IP][rfc791].

These are things that are impossible to teach in a single meeting, but there are many tutorials and explanations of these topics on the Internet that you will want to read to gain background knowledge.

> Theory without practice is futile. Practice without theory is fatal.

The only way to really learn security is to not only read but to do.

Learn the skills needed to complete a few introductory wargames and you will have a much better understanding of what is going on at club meetings.
I highly recommend you complete [Bandit][bandit] and then work on either [Natas][natas] or [Narnia][narnia].
If you are particulary interested in exploitation, [Io][smash] is also quite good.
There are also other wargames linked on the [Resources][rec] page.

One of the best ways to learn any new skill is to collaborate with others. 
To this effect, we host an [IRC][IRC_intro] channel for club members to discuss what they are working on or trying to learn. We are developing a tutorial to explain how to set up a persistent connection to IRC. In the meantime a not-so-beautiful web interface is also available [here][irc].

## When you have questions
First, [Google][goog] it.
We'd like to foster a culture of self-driven learning.

If you don't know what you are looking for, try our [Resources][rec] page.

You are always welcome to ask us questions on [IRC][irc].
