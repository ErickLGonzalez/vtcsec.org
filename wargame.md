The wargame is a (currently offline) ongoing competition run by the
Cyber Security Club at Virginia Tech.
Originally intended for members of the Cyber Security Club,
the wargame is now open to any interested party, regardless of affiliation.
To prevent use of machines as attack vectors, access to the wargame network
is available only through an isolated VPN.
To connect, you will need a machine with OpenVPN installed
([Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) comes with this by default)
and some credentials.

The wargame infrastructure is currently being completely reimplemented.
We love you all, and thank you for your patience. <3
