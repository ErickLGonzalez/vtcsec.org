# VTCSEC Web-Dev Branch:

1. Everything on this should be human readable. This means that if something is
messed up please send an email to one of the contributors, make a pull request, or
just ask to do web-dev for [VTCSEC](http://vtcsec.org/).

2. Please if you want to contribute contact a [Website Administrator](http://vtcsec.org/contact/) on IRC or by the [email](officers@vtcsec.org).

3. If you do not like the way this website has been implemented, please remake
it. We want the best technologies of the time and have a nice responsive webpage
so by all means make a pull request, or contact people.

4.  To update the React Bootstrap please refer to [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

5. If you find a vulnerability in something I wrote, please patch it immediately. I do not want anything that could cause a problem in the future so just submit a pull request **ASAP**.
