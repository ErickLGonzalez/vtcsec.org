what: Intro to assembly and basic process layouts
---

This week Jean-Philippe will be giving an introductory-level talk on some of the basic principles required for all reversing & binary exploitation work.
We will look briefly at how code is compiled,
with an emphasis on identifying some common patterns in compiler-generated assembly &mdash; one of the most fundamental skills of reverse engineering.
We will look at some basic control flow structures (loops, conditionals, etc.),
and calling conventions.
We will introduce the stack with lots of diagrams and examples.
Finally, we will examine and explain the full memory mappings of some real-world programs.

We hope to see you there!
