what: Memory, x86, the Stack, and You!
---

This week Jean-Philippe will be giving a talk on x86, the stack, and memory.
He will be covering basic memory layout, the layout of the call stack, and common x86 instructions.
He will also be talking about the compiler toolchain (how does C become x86, anyhow?) and the translation of some common C idioms into x86.

We hope to see you there!
