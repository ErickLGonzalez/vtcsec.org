Hey all! Welcome back to the old hats and welcome to anyone who is new to the club.
We have changed rooms this semester and will now meet in Torgersen Hall room 1020.
I will explain motivations for this change at the meeting.
We will continue to meet on Thursdays at 6:30pm as we did last semester.
New members, please read our ['Getting Started'][start] page.

As we will likely have several new members at this meeting, we will be discussing some of the things the club does and also asking current and new members what they hope to accomplish this semester.
We will introduce the leadership of the club and handle some bureaucratic business (yippee!) such as planning for officer elections.
We will also discuss the news in cyber security from the past month as well as have some members relate their experiences at a few conferences that happened over winter break.
We hope to see you there!
