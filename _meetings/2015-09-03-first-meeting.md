what:  "CTF Preparation Meeting"
---
We have reserved a room for the semester. Club meetings this Fall will be held in WLH 320 (Lavery Hall / upstairs of Turner Place) on Thursdays at 6:30pm. Many thanks to Carolyne Dudding with the Navy ROTC for her willingness to relinquish one of the rooms they had reserved for tutoring this semester. 

Our next meeting will be a capture-the-flag (CTF) preparation meeting. See the [CTF Field Guide][ctfguide] for more info as to what a CTF is and why you should be interested in participating. We'll have some challenges for you to play to get familiar with jeopardy-style CTF environments and to try to identify particular areas on which you may want to focus. Some areas of interest are cryptography, reverse engineering, network forensics and web exploitation. 

To prepare for this and other meetings please bring a laptop with [VirtualBox][virtualbox] or other virtualization software running [this virtual machine][vm].

We hope to see you there!
