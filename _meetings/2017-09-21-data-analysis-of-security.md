In this meeting, Zach will cover some of his current research in spatial-temporal anomaly analytics and machine learning. A good portion of the talk will be about the basics of what machine learning is (gradient descent, Bayes rule, other useful statistical concepts) and how it has been used in security (defeating facial recognition, hidden voice commands, malware analysis).
