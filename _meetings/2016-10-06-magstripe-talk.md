"Ever wonder how mag stripe works?  I'll show you that and how to spoof it.  It's easy and anyone can do it.  
I'll bring a magstripe reader/writer that people can use. I'll go over my design for a credit card sized 
device that can emulate a magnetic stripe and show the PCB around and demo it.  I'll talk about how chip 
and pin works and whether or not you can actually spoof it.  Maybe talk about Samsung/Google/Apple pay 
technologies."
