At this meeting, we will be starting up a long running Capture the Flag competition for the club. While tonight we will be working on it together, it will be up all of this semester and next semester for everyone to work on. If you have never done a CTF this is for you! If you have experience with challenges, this is for you too!

If you can't make it to the meeting tonight, here are the details on the competition so you can join in on the fun. It is hosted at <a href="https://vtcsec.virginiacyberrange.net/">VTCSEC Cyber Range</a>. Go there and make an account. Each person will be on their own team, use (and verify) your VT email, and start work on what is there. Members of the club will be adding challenges throughout the semester, so keep an eye on things. On that note, if you want to make a challenge, please do! Get in contact with us officers and we will put it up.
