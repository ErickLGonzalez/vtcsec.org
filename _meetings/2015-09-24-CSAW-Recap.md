what: Review of Challenges from CSAW Quals 2015
---

On our meeting this Thursday we will continue our recent tradition of weekly news updates from Conor Patrick regarding current events.
These updates will include breaches, vulnerabilities, and happenings since the last meeting.

We will be spending much of this week's meeting talking about the challenges from the CSAW Capture the Flag competition this past weekend.Thanks to everyone who came and participated! We had a great showing this year and ended up 26/301 among undergraduate teams from the US and Canada.
Though we did not qualify for the finals this is the best showing the club has had in the competition and we are optimistic about future CTFs and CSAW in future semesters.

If anyone competed with us (or independently) and wants to present a problem, they are welcome to do so at the meeting.
Similarly, if you have been playing a wargame and have solved a particularly interesting challenge, we welcome commentary on those challenges as well.
We will be talking about additional opportunities to play wargames and capture-the-flag competitions this semester.

For future meetings, our goal is to spend the first 30 minutes or so after news talking about some interesting application or concept in a lecture-style format similar to Conor's talk last week.
For the last 30 to 45 minutes we will have some hands-on offensive security instructables.

We hope to see you there!

PS: I forgot to post this before the meeting, but want it to be present in the archive of past meetings.
So it goes.
