This week Phillip Kobezak will be presenting on the Log Archiving and Analysis (LAA) project.  The LAA project is an initiative born out of the IT Security Office and Lab.  The LAA project is deploying central logging to benefit information security, IT operations, and research.  Specifically, we are deploying ELK (the Elastic stack, Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and Kafka) at scale.  We currently maintain 74 TBs in our Elasticsearch cluster and receive about 250 GBs of logs per day.  LAA is really about enabling network security analytics.  We want to find security issues quickly and reduce detection time.
