"I will be discussing the process and logistics of taking control of an IoT device, the Philips Hue Bridge. In this presentation I will go over the basics of ARP spoofing (a type of Man in the Middle attack), packet analysis with Wireshark, and the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). We will take a look at the Philips Hue API, and discuss some possible approaches for Philips to defend against this type of attack." -Ryan
