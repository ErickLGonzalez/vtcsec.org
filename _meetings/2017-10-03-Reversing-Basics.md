We have another beginner meeting this week at 6:30 pm in TORG 1020.  We shall begin reverse engineering.  We shall go over how processors work so that we can better understand machine code and begin to turn that machine code back into source code.

C will be used to explain the concepts, so you should come familiar some very basic C syntax like assignment, if statements, and while/for loops.  If you want to follow along, please bring some form of Linux.  These lessons will eventually lead into some basic exploitation in a couple weeks.
