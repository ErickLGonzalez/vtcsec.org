Hey everyone! Welcome back to Tech, we hope you had a wonderful break. This semester all meetings will be held in Torgersen 1010. This first meeting will be an introduction and review, so if you are new or interested feel comfortable to stop by and see what all the fuss is about. 

The basic agenda for this meeting is we will first give an overview of what the club is about and what can be expected. After that will be a brief news segment on the cybersecurity happenings that occured over the break. Then we will give a live demonstration of how to listen in on a Bluetooth headset and talk about why it is insecure. Last we will talk about how to get involved in the club this semester for both returning and new members and sketch out the overall schedule. If you have any questions head on over to the 'Contact' page, we wil be glad to answer. We hope to see you there!
