Tonight we will be having our usual meeting in TORG 1040, at 18:30. Our speaker is Michael Cantrell, a PhD student currently doing research on network traffic analysis. He will be speaking on some of his past work on quantum secure crypto (summary below). As a final note, Michael is currently working with Cisco as part of his PhD, so if you are interested in full time employment there, he has stated he can and will look at resumes. 

### Speaker Summary:
> A discussion geared towards creating an intuitive understanding of quantum-secure, Leighton Micali hash-based signature schemes. As a result this talk will be relatively high level and avoid diving into deep details and mathematics. We will also touch on some of the implementation results from a few different computing platforms.
