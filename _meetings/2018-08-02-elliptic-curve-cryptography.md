Tonight, we have our weekly Thursday meeting at 6:30 pm in TORG 1040. Riley is going to talk about an independent study he did last Spring on elliptic curve cryptography. Our goal is to clear up some of the dark magic that goes on behind the scenes in this public key crypto system. We will talk about why we use it, what an elliptic curve is, and how we can utilize one for cryptography.
