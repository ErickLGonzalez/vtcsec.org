Tonight, we have another beginner meeting at 6:30 pm in TORG 1020.  We'll go over symmetric cryptography including some basic symmetric ciphers and how to break them.  We'll also talk about AES and its various modes including some potential weaknesses in trying to implement a system that uses symmetric cryptography.
