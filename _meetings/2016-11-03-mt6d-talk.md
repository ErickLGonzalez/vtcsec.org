what: MT6D (Moving Target IPv6 Defense)
---
by Joe Sagisi

"Moving Target IPv6 Defense (MT6D) is a technique used to hinder a malicious actor's ability to observe or attack critical or sensitive infrastructure at the network layer.  This is done by rapidly changing IPv6 addresses to cryptographically generated pseudorandom values, creating what is essentially a "moving target" through the vastness of IPv6 address space.  Current MT6D implementations are generally run in software on top of Linux distributions or on embedded devices.  

I will be talking about implementing Moving Target IPv6 Defense in hardware as a dedicated inline network processor.  I'll also talk about some of the enabling FGPA technologies and how they integrate."
