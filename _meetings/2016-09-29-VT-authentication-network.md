what: VT Wireless Network Authentication
---
by Zachary Burch

"This talk will go over the setup of the VT wireless network, how a mobile device goes from connecting to an access point to being fully connected to the internet, and a few of the edge cases for this. Then some known attack vectors against the authentication system VT uses will be introduced and then I will detail one example for how an outside attacker could get complete network access. Finally, we will discuss as a group other potential attack vectors against the network and how they might be defended against."
