Advanced Encryption System (AES) is one of the most commonly used symmetric ciphers used today and it works excellently. I will be going over the theoretical background for the cipher and why it works, then we will go over the implementation details for the cipher and why it works so fast. Then there will be discussion about the different methods of using this cipher and how it is commonly misused.
