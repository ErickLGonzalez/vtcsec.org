Our first beginner meeting is this Tuesday. These meetings aim to help provide a baseline of knowledge for the various fields in Cyber Security.  Generally, Tuesdays assume some knowledge of programming concepts, but with no specific language in mind.

An overview of Cyber Security and Hacking as a whole will be presented. A few of the various fields within security will be explained, and questions about how to get started will be answered.
