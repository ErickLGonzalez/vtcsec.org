what: Theory and practice of privilege separation
---

This week Jean-Philippe will give an introduction to privilege separation.

Privilege separation is:

> a technique in which a program is divided into parts which are limited to
> the specific privileges they require in order to perform a specific task.
> This is used to mitigate the potential damage of a computer security attack.

We will learn by example by looking at the architecture of various daemons
from [OpenBSD][bsd], for example:

 - [OpenNTPD][ntp]
 - [OpenSMTPD][smtp]
 - [OpenSSH][ssh]
